                <h1>NS Website Design</h1>
                <p>We are a newly formed Nottingham based Digital Agency. Our 
                    speciality is creating an online presence for your business. 
                </p>
                <p>We believe that our work speaks for itself. That is why we want
                    to rapidly build up a portfolio work we can be proud of.
                    Therefore, until November 1st 2015, we are offering 
                    excellent rates starting as low as £250 all inclusive. </p>
                <h2>Types of Website</h2>
                <p>When discussing new creations with our clients, we
                    have in depth discussions to formulate exactly the kind of 
                    website our clients need. The following are some of the
                    broad categories.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Business Card</b> - A number of pages which explain 
                        your business and your services / products, list your
                        opening hours and display your location and contact 
                        information. </li>
                    <li><b>E-Commerce Website</b> - If you want enable your
                        customers to buy your products / services online, you 
                        will need an interactive site, where users can perform 
                        actions such as 'adding items to their shopping cart', 
                        'proceed to payment' etc.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Dynamic Content Website</b> - Should you need a website 
                        which requires that you update the content frequently,
                        we can build a site which has a simple and user friendly 
                        interface allowing non technical personnel to easily 
                        update the articles / pages which appear on the website.
                        This site is built and delivered with a Content
                        Management System, for example, Joomla or Wordpress.
                        Full training is provided on how to
                        use and update the site.
                </ul>
                <h3>Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)</h3>
                <p>All our creations are built to be optimised for search engines. 
                    This means that your site will be built in a way which 
                    encourages Google and other search engines to 
                    place your site high on the list of search results.
                    We do not promise that you will be number one for all search
                    results and you should be wary of anybody that does. We do 
                    promise to optimise your site according to the latest 
                    industry standards. </p>

                <h4>Website Portfolio</h4>
                <p>As we have not been in operation for long, our portfolio of
                    work is growing rather than complete. However, as we are 
                    keen to grow our body of work to showcase what we can do, 
                    we are currently offering highly competitive rates.
